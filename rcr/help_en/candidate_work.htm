<h1>Managing Candidates in the Database</h1>

<P>With E-Staff, you can track&nbsp; all records for a candidate, including 
phone calls, interviews, résumé submission to the contact, testing or assessment 
(if any), job offer, etc.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = 
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /></P>
<P>A candidate may be selected for one 
ore several vacancies at the same time, with separate 
states 
for each vacancy. For each selected vacancy the application displays 
the current list of candidates in a 
convenient form.</P>
<P>E-Staff also helps finding 
candidates that were 
stuck in a 
certain state for a prolonged period &nbsp;(e.g., 
no feedback from the contact person for more that five 
days, or no further action 
taken more than three days 
after an 
interview).</P>
<P>&nbsp;A newly added candidate has one 
of the following states: <STRONG>[</STRONG><STRONG>New 
candidate]</STRONG>, <STRONG>Found in 
Internet</STRONG> or <STRONG>Ad 
response</STRONG>, depending on 
how a 
candidate was inserted. Personal events list of such a candidate is either empty or contains 
single event (<STRONG>Found in 
Internet</STRONG> or <STRONG>Ad 
response</STRONG>). As you are working 
with a candidate, his/her <B>Events</B> 
list is extended with new events. The 
most recent event is defined a candidate's 
state.</P>
<P>A candidate can be either active or 
inactive (archived). Inactive candidates are displayed with gray 
icons.</P>
<P>A newly added candidate is 
active and remains active until all vacancies 
s/he is being viewed for are closed. If a 
candidate is rejected or put in reserve before the vacancy is 
closed, a candidate&nbsp; also becomes 
inactive.</P>
<P>If an inactive candidate is selected again 
for a vacancy, s/he&nbsp; is restored to 
the active state.</P>
<P>&nbsp;E-Staff has 
a built-in calendar for scheduling 
events with candidates or contact persons (interviews, meetings, phone calls, 
etc.). E-Staff’s built-in calendar may be integrated with 
Microsoft Outlook.</P><br/>
