<h1>Managing Clients</h1>

<P>For staffing agencies, E-Staff recruitment software provides CRM 
functionality and allows clients, contacts, and events to be stored in a singe 
database. Clients can be categorized by industry, size, region, current working 
state, and other criteria. You can attach any number of documents and files to a 
client's card, with an ability to search their content by keywords.</P>
<P>A contact may be assigned a set of roles, allowing you to distinguish between 
consumers of your products or services and other technical contacts (legal, IT, 
etc.). E-Staff keeps records when a contact person moves from one company to 
another. Because there is &nbsp;a single list of all persons in the system, a 
contact person may be considered a candidate at the same time.</P>
<P>All this functionality may also be used by HR departments to store external 
suppliers (service providers).</P><br/>
