<h1>Candidate card</h1>




<p>Each candidate card in E-Staff is structured this way:</p>

<p>A tree of card sections is displayed in the upper-left
corner of the card. Click the tree section you need and the data is displayed
in the right part of the window. </p>

<p>The status area is located below the tree. It displays
information on positions the candidate is currently selected for. If you browse
the card of a new candidate, this area is blank. </p>

<p>The card attributes are displayed below the status area in
the lower left corner of the window. The card’s creation date and the last
update are shown here. If you use a multi-user version of E-Staff, the
information on the user who created the card and who edited the card last is
also displayed in this window. </p>

<p>The main part of the card is the right part of the window. </p>

<p>Depending on the tree section selected, the following
information is displayed: </p>

<p>When you choose <b>General</b>, you see the candidate’s general information
in the main part of the card.</p>

<p>The # field is filled in automatically, but can be edited manually. If you
are not satisfied with the general mode of assigning numbers to cards, you can
change this by accessing the Numbering section in the general settings window
(Tools menu, General Settings item).</p>

<p>The following fields are usually filled in automatically during résumé
import: Last Name, First Name, Date of Birth, Address, Phone, and E-Mail. If
you create a card manually, you must fill these fields in. If a candidate has
an email address, click the icon above the <b>E-Mail</b> field to create an
email message to the candidate (his/her email address is automatically entered
in the “To” field).</p>

<p>The <b>Profession </b>field is used to classify candidates according to
their specialties. By default, E-Staff uses a two-level reference book of
professions supplied with the application. You may edit this book or replace it
with a single-level book (access the Professions section in the general
settings window;Tools menu, General Settings item).</p>

<p>The <b>Comments</b> field is used to store more info on a candidate.</p>

<p>The candidate’s résumé file is displayed in the lower part of the <b>General</b>
section. You can edit this résumé file and attach as many résumés as you like
and attach other documents to a candidate card. All the documents you attach
are displayed in the section tree in the upper left corner.</p>

<p><b>To attach a new document</b> </p>

<p>·  Click the <b>Attach Document</b> toolbar
button in the upper part of the card </p>

<p>·  Type your text or import it from a Word file.
</p>

<p>·  The lower part of the General section always
displays the first résumé in the list. The Records section lists the
candidate’s history after s/he was added to the database, including selection
for a position, phone calls, interviews, etc. Any comments you add are also
displayed in the list. </p>

<p><b>To open an event card</b> </p>

     highlighted in blue. </li>
