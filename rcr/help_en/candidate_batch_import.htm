<h1>Batch Import of Resumes</h1>

<P>For large numbers of résumés in Word or scans via fax, you may want to use 
E-Staff’s batch résumé import. The results are the same as those described in 
the previous section. You do not have to &nbsp;select each résumé manually, as 
E-Staff automatically processes all files located in the folder you select.</P>
<P><B>To run the batch résumé import</B> </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Click the <B>Resume Processing/From Microsoft Word</B> item displayed in 
  the left side of the main E-Staff window. 
  <LI>Specify the full path to the folder where the résumés are located in the 
  <B>Folder</B> field or select the folder by clicking <B>Browse</B>. 
  <LI>Select the <B>Include Subfolders</B> checkbox to process the files located 
  in the subfolders of the folder you selected. </LI></UL>
<P>Rarely will you want to edit the value of the <B>Files Types</B> field. By 
default, all Word files are&nbsp; processed. You can, however, specify a file 
name template in this field and only the file names that match this template are 
processed. </P>
<P><B>Example</B>: You enter a template like Resume*.doc,CV*.doc, and E-Staff 
processes only files with names that begin with “Résumé” or “CV.”</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Click <B>Import</B>&nbsp; to begin importing. </LI></UL>
<P>E-Staff starts importing and parsing résumés. The name of the file currently 
processed and the overall number of files processed is shown at the bottom of 
the window.</P>
<P>The résumé contents are recognized and entered in the database. For a single 
résumé, this takes 2-5seconds, depending on your computer. While the import 
runs, you can switch to other sections and continue to work with E-Staff. If the 
number of résumés is very high, you may wish to run the import &nbsp;after 
business hours.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>To interrupt the import</B> </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Click the <B>Stop</B> button. </LI></UL>
<P>To continue the import from the same folder, E-Staff prompts you to continue 
with the résumés next to the last one imported before the 
interruption.</P></body>
