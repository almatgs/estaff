<h1>Pasting Resumes from Clipboard</h1>

<P>Pasting 
resumes 
from&nbsp; Clipboard is the most commonly 
used method of importing a single resume. Use <B>Past</B><B>e Resume</B> 
when you have opened the resume on the screen (found on Web, 
opened in a text editor or in email client), and you are ready to put 
it into a database. E-staff automatically creates a 
candidate's card and parses the 
resume content into the appropriate 
fields. The source resume will be 
attached to the card in its original form.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns =
