<h1>Managing organizational structure</h1>

<P>When used by the HR department, E-Staff provides a way to manage the 
organization and personnel structure, including divisions, positions, and 
employees. The data may be stored with various levels of detail, depending on 
the users' needs.</P>
<P>It is possible to load the organization and personnel&nbsp;structure 
automatically from the personnel management system (if an integration&nbsp;has 
been&nbsp;set up), or to complete if manually using the <STRONG>File</STRONG> 
menu. If you enter organization and personnel structure manually, you may 
complete it gradually, along with appropriate vacancies.</P>
<P><B>Org. structure</B> section contains a hierarchical list of company 
divisions.</P>
<P><B>Employees</B> section contains a list of all employees in a company.</P>
<P><B>Positions</B> section contains a list of all staff positions in a company. 
The presence of this section is optional, depending on E-Staff usage policy, 
specified with <B>Use positions</B> checkbox in <B>Administration-&gt;Global 
section-&gt;Organization structure</B>. When using positions, each employee may 
(or must) be bound to a position, which is freed when an employee is dismissed. 
Each vacancy may (or must) be bound to a position as well. When not using 
positions, you are free to assign any name to a vacancy or any position title to 
an employee. </P>
